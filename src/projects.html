These projects include creating responsive and visually appealing websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have focused on implementing interactive features, improving user experience, and ensuring compatibility across different devices. Each project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply and solidify my knowledge in frontend development.</p>
